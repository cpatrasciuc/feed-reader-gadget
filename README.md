==================

A gadget that lets you get a sneak preview of your favorite RSS feeds around the web. 

All you have to do is to provide the URL to an RSS 2.0 or Atom feed. The gadget will fetch the information from the feed and display the title and the description of each item. If the user clicks on the title of an item, a browser will open at the corresponding link. 

The gadget can refresh the information every 15, 30 or 60 minutes. It can also be refreshed manually by clicking on the name of the gadget. 

When it is undocked, the gadget grows in size to allow more information to be displayed.
