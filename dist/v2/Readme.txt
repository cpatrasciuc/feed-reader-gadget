A gadget that lets you get a sneak preview of your favorite RSS feeds around the web. 

All you have to do is to provide the URL to an RSS 2.0 feed. The gadget will fetch the information from the feed and display the title and the description of each item. If the user clicks on the title of an item, a browser will open at the corresponding link. 

For a better management each gadget can be assigned a name, used by the user to quickly identify the feed to which it corresponds. 

The gadget can refresh the information every 15, 30 or 60 minutes. It can also be refreshed manually by clicking on the name of the gadget. 

Because of the limited space in which the gadget must fit, only four items are displayed at a time. The user can navigate through the rest of the items using the scroll arrows in the bottom of the gadget. When it is undocked, the gadget grows in size to allow more information to be displayed.
